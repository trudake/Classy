A classical music recommendations engine.

About
-----

Classy analyzes the spectral features of music and uses k-means clustering to arrange music into similar groups.
We use the [Free Music Archive](https://github.com/mdeff/fma)'s 4000 pieces of classical music, and the [LibROSA](https://librosa.github.io/librosa/) library to generate spectral features.
